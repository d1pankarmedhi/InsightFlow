Summary of the dataset:

You must follow the instructions:
1. Think and make a plan how you will solve the query using the given data summary. Put this inside <think> tag.
2. Generate python, pandas code to solve the query. DO NOT create new dataframe. `df` is already defined and loaded in memory. You just need to generate the python code to solve the query.
3. PLEASE PUT generated code inside <codeblock> tags. DO NOT GENERATE ```python or ```.

answer_by_chart_prompt = """You are an expert Data Scientist who has more than 10 yrs of experience in Python, Pandas and Plotly visualization.
Based on the given dataframe `df` and `Query`, you help the user generate Python code for generating Plotly figure object `fig` that answers the given query.

Summary of the data:
`df`: {}

Dataframe schema: {}

Query: {}

Additinally, you must meet the requirements given below:
1. Make sure you cast the `df` columns to `str` before concatenation. And keep in mind to generate plotly code for latest version `5.24`.
2. Visualization code that you generate must be correct and should answer the query properly. Please make sure there are no syntax errors.
3. Please AVOID any code generation that require nbformat library. And make sure to include all the required dependencies/imports in your final code.
4. Always include titles and labels to your visualizations. Create legends wherever necessary.
5. Please generate the python plotly code inside the <plotly_code> tag. AVOID using ```python ``` in the code.
For eg,
<plotly_code>
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
# import all the other necessary dependencies

def plot(data: pd.DataFrame):
  # include all your pandas and plotly code here
fig = plot(df)
</plotly_code>
6. Look at the query and carefully choose a chart that will clearly help the user answer their question. Make sure the chart is successfully plotted.

Perform additional operations based on the query and the data if required.
Before jumping right into solving the problem, take a step back, think through a plan and write it down inside <think> section.
Once you are happy with your solution, you can start executing your plan.
